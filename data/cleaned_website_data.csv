https://vitbhopal.ac.in/cyber-security/,Cyber Security - VIT Bhopal,"In this age of quick information, Internet is the engine that is ushering global economic growth, connectivity & relentless communication. The issues related to cyber security of any country, should not impede any of these factors. Instead it is important to create such initiatives and be well-equipped to face and take head-on those cyber offences, that could cause espionage, infringement into copyrights, financial thefts, stealing personal data etc, which can threaten security, financial issues and confidentiality of a person, organization or even a nation. It is no exaggeration to say that the battles in the future will probably be fought in cyberspace instead on land or sea, with the targets being critical infrastructure such as dams and power grids and even healthcare. This has already been attempted in the past. Till date, more than 26,000 websites have been defaced and 91 lakh infected systems have been detected in India. The year 2016 saw over 3 million debit cards getting hacked in India. Worse, 80% of all cybercrimes go unreported! This makes it super important that India fortifies its critical infrastructure and evolves a mechanism that can be practically implemented in case of any cyber breach. And this is where the role of cyber warriors comes in. Understanding the programme a little better In next few years, India will require millions of Cyber Security Professionals to keep the people, organizations and even the economy of India, safe and protected against these high-tech crimes.

https://vitbhopal.ac.in/edutech/,Education Technology - VIT Bhopal,"Education technology facilitates the learning process and improves the quality of education. Over the last decade, the education domain has shifted from teacher-centric to learner-centric, and now to collaborative and active learning. Furthermore, information technology has progressed from stand-alone computing systems to distributed computing systems, and now to automotive computing systems. In the form of Educational Technology, combining the areas of education and information technology affects the learning environment, teaching approaches, student learning, and corporate operations. Teachers can use educational software and technology to make their classes more interesting and enriching. Teachers can employ technology to imitate real-world learning opportunities and provide students with access to research materials. Technology also aids education access, particularly as schools struggle to adapt to remote learning in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Increased smartphone usage and a shift to digital-learning paradigms have accelerated this trend. Both Covid 19 and Industry 4.0 have revolutionized the educational system. This degree program prepares educators how to use technology effectively in the classroom. Curriculum supervisors and instructional coaches can use this degree to help instructors learn how to use new technology effectively. Educators expertise is needed in many areas, including the development of online learning platforms and new software solutions for the education business. In 2021, AI and Machine Learning are expected to have a 47 percent increase in influence in Educational Technology. The capacity of these technologies to automate even the most fundamental functions, such as grading, communication, inquiries, feedback, evaluation, and progress, enhances the entire user experience. Learning will become more dynamic in the future. The future of education would be hybrid, multilingual, and personalized. This paradigm shift demands the graduate as an educational specialist in order to work as an educational consultant, solution architect, or edutect developer. Academic credit banks and learning autonomy are emphasized in the National Education Policy (NEP). This opens up a number of possibilities for digital solutions. Understanding the programme a little better VIT Bhopal s four-year B.Tech CSE (Educational Technology) prepares young graduates for careers as instructional designers (who plan and prepare instructional programmes), educational consultants (who work with professional educators to improve the quality of teaching and learning), educational technology specialists (who assist others in designing, planning, and using technology in schools, universities, and similar settings), and more. 4 years E-Learning has become a booming industry that gives an avenue to learn anytime and anywhere. Several Instruction Design Companies generate revenue in terms of providing solutions through AI-enabled software."
https://vitbhopal.ac.in/gaming-technology/,Gaming Technology - VIT Bhopal,"Game technology is developing so rapidly that it will reach over 300 billion by 2026. We can expect game platforms to continue developing in 2019 onwards with billions of dollars in profit and over 2.5 billion gamers around the world. Besides the consistent and impressive growth of the industry, it is interesting to note that there has been a shift in revenue sources in the gaming space lately. The gaming industry used to make most of its money by selling games but today its revenue is coming from a different perspective. Understanding the programme a little better Game Development at VIT Bhopal includes not only the art of game development, but also Computer Science and Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science. Most of the courses in the curriculum are practical oriented. The curriculum attracts all kinds of students having interest and skills in various categories like competitive programming, game design and mechanics, human computer interaction and artificial engineering etc. Apart from this, students of Gaming will complete 3 certifications NASSCOM Future skills, Unity and UiPath. The Gaming Department at VIT Bhopal has conducted 25+ events, 12 Master classes, 23 projects demonstrated in public and also has signed three MoUs with Unity Asia Pacific for Gaming, UI Path (USA) for RPA/Coding, Roach Interactive for Game Design. This department is considered to be one of the most active ones in the university. Here at VIT Bhopal, the students learn through self-exploration as each module increases their knowledge stack, brainstorming with peers as sharing ideas with like-minded people will help them. Students are given activities to trigger their creative centres. Also, group projects help students decide, discuss and implement their ideas to design games. Curriculum Highlights: World Design, Scripting, Storyboarding, Character Design, Animation, UI/UX Design, Lighting, Asset Design 4 years A Game Developer is one of the most intense and challenging programming and coding careers which brings the game mechanics into a fuel to the game. They test the program code and fix the flaws in the game while testing coding skills. Game Designers are professionals who have necessary skills to create/architect a game which includes planning and defining all the elements of the game: its setting, rules, environment, story flow, levels, etc. They help in giving life to the game. Game animation is a career which gives physical structure to the game world for example: characters, game environment and scene building in a game. Game Animators are the ones with high skills and knowledge of animation designing and softwares related to it. Game testers mostly play-test the sport in a very systematic way, they analyse the game s performance by identifying bugs and suggesting changes to the programmers, hence boosting the standard and playability of the e-sport. Narrative Designers work closely with Game Designers to feature context to the story, for instance, how the villain became the villain, why they have to be defeated, etc. Words are the tools here as they write dialogues for the characters and in-game text. Without sound, no game is complete. Audio Engineers are experts, who add realism to the in-game world with the help of sound tracks and sound effects. They are equipped with great knowledge of sound effects and sound creation. Journalists and critics are the key elements to any entertainment industry. They provide valuable reviews and critiques for the buyers whenever a new game is released on the market. DevOps Engineers are required to create and maintain the networks and servers.They are in charge of maintaining the smooth functioning and security of the server on which players are connected. Game Development is the art of creating, enhancing and release of a game. It involves concept generation, design, build, test, and release. While learning game development, a student learns all the skills not only for gaming and game development but also masters the skills that a regular computer science engineer learns. When one learns the art of game development, they master the art of videography, audio editing, coding, skill for Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Artificial Intelligence as well. This opens up not just the Gaming Industry and Computer Science industry for job opportunities but also music, film, software industry. Learning this course ensures that one masters all aspects of computer science along with game development. A student of the 2018-2022 batch, Jasjeev Singh has been given an offer by Roach Interactive, India for an offer of around Rs. 6 Lakhs based on his project work demonstrated in the project exhibition in August 2019. Not only this, but also, many students from the 2019-2023 have already developed games in their first semester which are now available on play store. Coding studios, Computer labs, Gaming studio, library with apt books, availability of VR sets are some of the facilities available at present. Along with all this, labs with high tech equipment are under construction exclusively for students learning game development. VIT Bhopal is one of the best engineering Institutes in Central India, offering a B.Tech course in CSE specialization in Gaming Technology. Coding studios, Computer labs, Gaming studio, library with apt books, availability of VR sets are some of the facilities available at present. Along with all this, labs with high tech equipment are under construction exclusively for students learning game development. These facilities make VIT Bhopal a preferred choice for pursuing a Gaming course. The gaming department of VIT Bhopal, specially the faculty and the people around me helped and encouraged me to push my limits and achieve things that I was too afraid to approach. The enthusiasm and energy in the people here can motivate anyone to reach goals that seem impossible to achieve. Let me give an example of my personal experience in the gaming department here. I ve been learning game development from over a year before coming to VIT Bhopal but I never ended up finishing or publishing a game in the process. After coming to VIT, in a game design class we were told to come up with a simple game idea with a team. So we came up with an idea and soon after that me and a friend decided to bring that idea to life. We ended up making that game in one month and that game is now live on Google Play available for the world to play. The mentorship here definitely helped me to get over the fear of putting my creation out in the public and moreover, I can now collaborate with my peers on projects because it s always easier and fun to create things with your friends who share similar interests as you. Supantha Paul 19BCG10011 India is emerging as a leader in the gaming sector because it has the aptitude and the skill set to meet the international standards. Gaming has now become one of the most lucrative career options. Only a few universities in India, VIT Bhopal being one of them, provides specialization in gaming technology. The curriculum is designed to meet the standards worldwide. Here gaming is a specialization along with Computer Science Engineering (CSE) giving more opportunities to its students than those graduating with plain CSE. With qualified and trained faculty, support by major Industries like Volkswagen Virtual Engineering and practice of CALTech (Collaborative and Active Learning through Technology) which includes presentations, projects, workshops and regular assignments for both theoretical and practical knowledge and an FFCS (Fully Flexible Credit System) which allows a student to plan on his own what and how he has to study, this university makes its students rich and efficient in this field. In short, if you are seriously looking forward to building an immense career in the game development field, VIT Bhopal might just be your best shot. Divya Matthew 19BCG10001"

https://vitbhopal.ac.in/2023/11/28/life-in-dirt-feeding-the-millions-unraveling-the-marvels-of-soil-microbial-diversity/,Life in Dirt: Feeding the Millions – Unraveling the Marvels of Soil Microbial Diversity - VIT Bhopal,"When we gaze at vast fields of crops swaying gently in the wind, we seldom think about the intricate world beneath our feet, where life teems in a complexity that rivals any bustling city. The soil, often overlooked, is a universe in itself, hosting a plethora of organisms, among which soil microbes stand out as silent heroes. These tiny life forms, invisible to the naked eye, play an indispensable role in our lives, especially when it comes to feeding the millions. At first glance, soil might appear as just dirt, but it s far more than that; it s a bustling ecosystem where countless organisms thrive. Among these, soil microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, are the unsung champions. They are nature s recyclers, breaking down organic matter, releasing essential nutrients, and ensuring the fertility of our lands. Soil microbial diversity, referring to the variety of these microscopic organisms, is a crucial factor in maintaining the delicate balance of our ecosystems. These tiny beings are the major regulators of fundamental ecosystem processes, such as organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling, and gaseous fluxes. In simpler terms, they are the architects of life beneath the surface. With only 2.4% of our land being arable, our country faces immense pressure to feed a population of 1.4 billion people1. In the pursuit of food security, we often adopt technologies without adequate testing. For instance, the introduction of Nano urea was touted as a solution, promoted by organizations like the IFFCO (Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited), claiming it to be beneficial for production and a replacement for traditional urea. However, recent research has indicated that the use of Nano liquid urea could result in significant yield losses2. Indiscriminate use of fertilizers, manures, pesticides, herbicides, or similar soil amendments has a profound adverse effect on soil microbial diversity. These microorganisms, vital for sustaining life in the soil, play a pivotal role in regulating essential ecosystem functions. This includes breaking down organic matter and cycling nutrients, which are crucial for maintaining soil productivity. To meet the increasing demand for food and ensure food security, our excessive greed has driven us to apply more and more fertilizers. However, this practice of soil nutrient enrichment has led to a situation of nutrient immobilization. It s akin to the tale of the greedy farmer who, in his eagerness for more, ended up harming the very source of his wealth, much like the farmer who killed the hen that laid golden eggs3. Soil bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, nematodes, and protozoa are important drivers of biogeochemical cycles4. The intricacies of microbial interactions remain a mystery, and scientists are actively investigating microbe-to-microbe communication. Simultaneously, due to human activities, numerous microbial species and other small soil organisms might be facing extinction, often without our awareness5. Take, for instance, Mycorrhiza, a microorganism recognized for its ability to establish a symbiotic relationship with plant roots, aiding in nutrient absorption from distant areas. Improper and excessive application of inorganic fertilizers results in a decline in these advantageous microbial communities6. In addition to the issue of excessive land use, it s alarming to note that according to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), one-third of all food produced in India goes to waste or spoils before reaching the consumer s table. The Ministry of Agriculture in India has quantified this wastage at nearly 50,000 crore INR annually7. However, the repercussions of this wastefulness extend far beyond mere financial losses; it encompasses the depletion of precious natural resources and the hard work of essential microorganisms. The situation is graver than it appears. It s not merely a matter of monetary loss; it involves the depletion of valuable natural resources and the efforts of vital microorganisms. This issue arises primarily due to a lack of awareness and carelessness, factors that contribute significantly to this widespread wastage. It s imperative that we address this problem urgently, adopting measures to raise awareness and promote responsible consumption to mitigate these losses and conserve our resources. In the grand tapestry of life on Earth, microorganisms have been thriving for billions of years, long before humans came into existence. Over the course of these eons, they have painstakingly acquired genes that now play a crucial role in enhancing our productivity and ensuring the sustenance of our ecosystems. It is not just a responsibility but a moral obligation for us to uphold this delicate balance of nature. By embracing the principles of organic and sustainable agriculture, we can harmonize our endeavors with the natural world, acknowledging the profound contributions of these microscopic beings. Our journey towards sustainability hinges on our ability to understand and respect the intricate web of soil microbial communities. It is incumbent upon us to invest in research initiatives that delve deeper into the mysteries of this unseen world. While the allure of short-term gains and heightened productivity might tempt us, we must not lose sight of the greater, long-term goal: ensuring the continuity of life on Earth. This continuity is intrinsically linked with the world of microbes. As stewards of this planet, we must tread wisely, nurturing our relationship with these tiny but indispensable life forms. Only by embracing the microbial world and working in harmony with it can we hope to achieve a sustainable future for ourselves and for the countless generations yet to come.

Imagine your computer s hard drive, but on a much larger scale, accessible over the internet. This cloud of resources includes servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more. Instead of relying solely on your computer s power, you can tap into this vast digital landscape to perform tasks and store data. Cloud computing isn t a one-size-fits-all concept. It comes in different flavors, catering to various needs: Think of IaaS as a DIY cloud. It provides you with the basic building blocks to create your own virtual environment. Need a server? You got it. How about storage or networking components? They re there too. With IaaS, you have the flexibility to set up and manage your virtual infrastructure, much like building with digital Lego blocks. PaaS takes things up a notch by providing not just the infrastructure but also the tools and environment for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications. It s like having a fully equipped kitchen (complete with utensils and appliances) where you can cook up your software recipes without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. SaaS is like dining at a restaurant. You re served a ready-to-use application over the internet. No installation or setup required. From email services and office tools to entertainment platforms, SaaS applications are designed to make your life easier by taking care of all the technical details. The Perks of Cloud Computing So, why should you care about cloud computing? Here are some compelling benefits: Cost Savings: With cloud computing, you can say goodbye to hefty upfront hardware costs. Cloud services operate on a pay-as-you-go model, allowing you to scale resources up or down based on your needs. This flexibility means you re not paying for more than you use, which is a win for your wallet. Accessibility: Remember the days when you had to carry around a USB drive to access your files on different devices? Cloud computing eliminates that hassle. Your data and applications are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. All you need is a device to connect to the cloud. Scalability: Got a sudden surge in website traffic or a new project? Cloud computing lets you scale your resources quickly to meet these demands. No need to wait weeks for new hardware to arrive just a few clicks, and you re ready to roll. Collaboration Made Easy: Cloud services promote seamless collaboration. Multiple users can work on the same document simultaneously, regardless of their location. This real-time collaboration ensures everyone stays on the same page, boosting productivity. Security and Reliability: Contrary to what you might think, cloud providers invest heavily in security measures. Your data is often safer in the cloud than on a physical device prone to theft or hardware failure.

https://vitbhopal.ac.in/2023/08/29/renewables-for-rapid-and-sustainable-transition-in-the-power-sector/,Renewables for Rapid and Sustainable Transition in the Power Sector - VIT Bhopal,"The task of limiting global warming to 1.5 C is a huge and formidable challenge. India is experiencing an increase in erratic rains, heatwaves, and droughts due to climate change [1], which is causing catastrophic social and economic consequences. In India, the heavy dependence on low-quality coal and the operation of extremely inefficient power plants have given rise to greenhouse gas pollution while compounding various environmental concerns. The rapid transition towards renewable energy, particularly in the power sector, is the way forward to meet the Paris Agreement and achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals [2], [3]. India has shown significant expansion in renewable capacity installations, especially solar and wind, over the last few years. To put this in context, the total renewable energy generation capacity in India has reached 152.90 GW as of February 2022, 50.78 GW from solar energy, 40.13 GW from wind energy, 10.63 GW from bio-energy, and 46.52 GW and 4.84 GW from large and small hydropower respectively [4]. However, the contribution of renewable energy in electricity generation varies substantially across Indian states. For instance, in states like Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Kerala, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Maharashtra, the electricity generation from renewables exceeds the national average of 8.2% by a substantial margin, whereas other Indian states are lagging in power generation capacity and production [5]. A recently published research article by Ashish et al. [6] in Nature Communications answered two critical questions: 1) Is an energy system powered entirely by renewable energy technically feasible in India and will it be the low expensive option in 2050, 2) How much and what will be the requirements for state and national production capacity, storage and flexibility during the transition? The power transition to 100% renewable energy by 2050 is crucial for India s sustainable energy transition. The study explores the power transition pathway in different states of India by incorporating several power generation alternatives, storage technologies, and interstate transmission to effectively fulfill hourly electricity demands over a complete year. Employing the LUT Energy System Transition Model tool [7], [8] from Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT), the study formulates scenarios for India s journey towards achieving a 100% renewable and sustainable energy resources. The research provides some notable findings. Ashish et al. [6] find that integrating large shares of renewables for electricity generation by 2050 could be less expensive and eliminate coal-dominated systems. The reason behind this approach lies in establishing a power generation system primarily reliant on hydropower, wind energy, and solar photovoltaic. To ensure the system s flexibility and stability, supplementary power will be derived from batteries and engines fueled by synthetic fuels. The findings also indicate zero greenhouse gas emissions in the power sector by 2050, compared to current national levels of around 1.2 GtCO2eq in 2020. Interestingly, the renewable transition route could reduce power transformation losses from 57% in 2020 to 9.3% in 2050. Furthermore, the levelised cost of electricity of the system could reduce from 69.5 $/MWh in 2020 to 37.2 $/MWh by 2050. Credit: Pixabay Image The study has a few limitations that could be explored in future studies. First, this research does not consider electrification in other power sectors such as transportation, heating/cooling and industry. This may result in a further rise in power demand throughout the transition. Second, the water footprint of renewable power generation is not adjusted for in this study. The use of water for cooling in coal-fired power plants is an issue. It is estimated that by the end of 2030, two-thirds of India s power plants will face an acute water crisis. [9]. Therefore, a more solicitous evaluation of electricity-based water consumption would add another dimension to the debate over the sustainability of renewable-based power systems. Third, the model optimises potential capacities for wind energy and solar photovoltaic based on specific capacity densities, cost considerations, and land use limitations, it also does not determine resource locations that might preclude development in some of the suggested locations due to social constraints. Despite these limitations, the research findings instill optimism by suggesting that the ambitious goals outlined in the Paris Agreement to restrict temperature rise to 1.5 C are within reach if large shares of clean, renewable energy can be integrated nationwide. Therefore, to meet this ambitious target, more efforts are needed to expand the renewable capacity in some states and the policies should be in line with the central government.

The research oriented jobs in research concerns has better prospects than a regular job. Yes. Any graduate from engineering disciplines is eligible for admission. Yes, most of the time. Unless if companies specifically ask for only UG/PG graduates, which is very rare. Obviously in software industries a PG graduate salary is better than a UG graduate salary. No, one has to attend classes in person unless there is any restrictions imposed by governments because of pandemic situations. Usually universities offer either AI or DS degree programs. Very rarely they offer such program. Of course it has. The laboratories are equipped with high end servers, clusters and workstations. They have all the software licenses one would require to carry out research in AI & DS. We have 100% doctoral faculty who do active research who are going to deliver the classes. Research oriented courses in AI & DS. Since it s the combination of AI and DS, it is different from our AI and DS programs. These technologies will exist for another 25 years at least. Yes. Since the future cannot exist without either AI/ML or DS."

https://vitbhopal.ac.in/2020/08/12/outdoor-to-indoor-education-always-finds-a-way-the-online-era/#respond,Outdoor to Indoor Education always finds a Way – The Online Era - VIT Bhopal,"In the last few decades, the mode of education has entirely reinvented itself repeatedly to evolve and adapt to the changes that we as a community have also undergone. It is beyond doubt that Learning Methods change as we learn and experience and the role of the Internet has been a huge influence on various such changes. From a non-existent system to being a network providing the largest most accessible database for information ever created, changing the way people communicate, gain knowledge, socialize, shop and earn on the Internet, all of which has seen a remarkable growth. Consequently, the mode of education has also evolved, now distance learning has become a reality through virtual classrooms and easily accessible online databases. A testament that Education always finds a Way The Online Era has become a reality and is here to stay and revolutionize the education system. Online Education has emerged as a New Normal today which portrays a relaxed and cost effective mode of learning with least effort and yet completely effective from either point of view the teacher and student. Being an education mode where the students use their home computers and the internet for a more non-traditional take on academic life, and has many advantages. This style has made online graduations, online courses etc. even more popular with the use of a number of digital media platforms and technologies. This computer/web based training is a flexible and versatile instruction delivery system that can encompass any kind of learning that used to take place in the real world before. Online learning provides educators an opportunity to reach out to students who may not be able to enroll into a traditional classroom course and, supporting students who need to work on their own schedule and pace. The quality of distance learning has tremendously improved with the necessity that we face today due to the pandemic. Many schools and institutes that offer online learning have increased rapidly. With almost infinite ways to teach and learn outside of traditional classrooms and away from college campuses online education is the best option dare I say even before the circumstances forced us. All you need is electricity and internet access and you get audio, video, text, animations, virtual training environments, live chats etc all at the tip of your fingers. This is what we refer to as rich learning with versatility that one can t find in traditional classrooms as it brings out the full potential on either side with least expenditure in terms of money, time or effort fully online degrees earned from the comfort of your home with no required visits to your college or university campus, libraries etc; what an opportunity to learn from anywhere! What you call and refer to as a drastic change, we call adaptive capability and evolution in the times of need. And things always get better when the majority depends on something. With the increase in online based activities around the world we have seen rapid growth in the field to facilitate its use to the vast multitude. For a country like India, as the Internet reaches the rural areas, doors to good education, better economic opportunities and effective healthcare systems, open and eventually aid the development of the country. Let s see the advantages of venturing into the online platform Reduced expenses The huge plus of online education would be the dip in money spent. Money requirement would minimize for classes, hostels, mess fees, activity fees, text books, membership fees and other random expenses. Online learning being an indoor method, there s no cost of commuting, assorted costs related to transport such as fuel, parking, vehicle maintenance, and public transportation costs etc. At the end of the day you seem to save money, time and in most cases, the environment as well. This will release the students from any and all burden in terms of debt and other criteria as well. With online classes, you re paying for the university credits while saving money. Reduced Load The intensity of every activity is significantly reduced; taking classes in the traditional way requires getting ready and showing up at a particular time every single day, sitting through a lengthy lecture class after class. If you space out, you lose the entire knowledge you ought to have gained in that class and there is little freedom compared to that at home. With online education, one chooses his/her own timing, can record sessions and catch up whenever possible, understand at your own pace, take snack breaks whenever wanted, stretch out and learn in comfort & style. All this reduces a good amount of load, unburdening an individual from great many things. 100% Attendance It doesn t matter where you live, it could be a downpour, it could be snow, or even a storm that stops you from getting up and walking out to get to class, because the class comes to you when it s online learning. All at the comfort of your very own home, attending classes online is as simple as switching on your computer, opening your laptop or even unlocking your smartphones/tablets. No rain soaked walks to and fro, no hypothermic marches, no sweaty hot days just you and your mind focused on learning at the comfort of your home. Additionally, you can be flexible about when you get things done, at your own leisurely manner as you create your own timetable. Students who juggle their careers and school will have a lot more freedom because they aren t tied down to a fixed schedule. All this reduces exhaustion relatively and it wouldn t matter if you are an early bird or a night owl, you can always have a 100% attendance with ease. Better Teacher Student Communication In some ways, even if the distance is greater, this method brings the students closer to their professors. You might not be physically present in class, but you can get easier access to any faculty whenever you need. In online classes you will always get your questions answered unlike traditional classes, this is because you can email them directly and eventually you will get a reply. This also helps the professors because they can record a class and post it online instead of streaming live and answer the questions while the session is being played through direct messages. Online communication emphasizes individual attention greater than the traditional method as it is easier to communicate with larger groups and the physical energy used is far lesser as the professors don t have to stand for long hours etc. Any College, Any Location You can get accredited while studying from home, attending exams from home, doing everything from home and get the degree from home; so, how does it matter where the college is located? The answer is it does not! Your choice university might have not been possible because it wasn t at your hometown or was too far away from it. But with online learning, it is possible now. There won t be anyone who is homesick from being away from home for too long at your hostels etc, because now you re doing it all from home. With this online mode of education, one can travel around the globe to get a degree while being where you are right now. There s no more Location Dependency factor to rule over your choice of university. A degree from any university, anywhere in the world, is now at your reach in this Online education era. Learning some Tech Skills There are plenty among us who have never been tech savvy or anything close to resembling computer skills within us. The most important skills that employees currently lack would be computer and technical skills. Of those reporting that they needed skills for their current job, 33% reported lacking technical skills, including basic computer skills. The online education system will push you to leave your comfort zone entirely and learn some basics and more to have some digital sense to thrive in this digital world. You will learn to navigate through portals, understand various online terms, surf through online course lectures, download materials, interact with other people online, communicate digitally and more all of which will become an extension of yourself with some practice and all these will come handy in your future as well as everything is bound to become more digital oriented, not less. Keeping pace with the evolving world is always a necessity and this is just one of many ways to achieve that pace. In conclusion, Online Education or Online Learning is a proven fantastic choice with no boundaries. Your email address will not be published.

https://vitbhopal.ac.in/2020/07/12/caltech-the-soul-of-teaching-learning-process-at-vit-bhopal-business-school/,"CALTech – The soul of teaching, learning process at VIT Bhopal Business School - VIT Bhopal","VIT Bhopal commenced operations in 2017 with Engineering and Business being the twin areas of study, teaching and research. Two of the most important distinctive features of VIT Bhopal are the presence of 100% doctoral faculty and the emphasis on the novel Collaborative Active Learning through Technology- CALTech, as the prime method of teaching learning. The word CALTech is a novel terminology coined by the illustrious Assistant Vice-President, Ms. Kadhambari S Viswanathan. In the education arena it is commonly accepted that peer-to-peer learning is one of the most effective methods of long lasting learning behaviour. This understanding has led to the creation of studio based class-rooms at VIT Bhopal, wherein students are made to sit around round tables in groups of 6 to 7. This enables them to interact in groups, which results in better understanding of the group dynamics, when the teacher gives them a hands-on assignment. The word Collaborative comes from this aspect of the teaching learning method. Students collaborate with each other in the learning process. They also make and deliver presentations at the end of their group assignment which augments their public speaking skills as well. Traditionally the method of teaching involved the process of the teacher delivering a lecture and the students participating in passive listening only. It has been very well concluded that this process was sub-optimum. Under CALTech the lecturing mode is incorporated for only one third of the total delivery time and makes the students learn by doing things and activities for the remaining two-thirds of the time. Once a student gets involved in doing, his learning is more durable and he is totally engrossed in the entire process for the whole duration of the class. This is a much more effective method of conducting the instruction process. As a result the student here is no more a passive listener but is transformed into an active doer first hand, hence the word Active in the acronym CALTech. Last but not the least, technology has become ubiquitous in the modern day workspace and education is not an exception in this regard. At the VIT Bhopal Business School faculty are actively encouraged to use technology in their lecture delivery up to the most optimum level. There are tools like Power Points, Moodle, Wifi, Videos, Video-conferencing etc. which have become indispensable in the Business School. This explains the term Tech which implies technology in the acronym CALTech. While the learning process becomes more engaging and fulfilling for the students in the CALTech process, it places a different set of demands on the faculty to take sessions in this mode. They have to come up with meaningful activities designed to impart to the students, the desired learning outcomes while keeping them thoroughly engrossed and engaged. It is very important that the activities are not disjointed and meaningless. They should flow from one to another in a seamless and smooth manner while being absolutely logical in their sequence. Small activities should form the building blocks of larger and more complex ones. They should lead to a sense of fulfilment in the minds of the students upon successful completion of the tasks. CALTech is such a process of teaching and learning which can be extremely rewarding to both the teacher and the taught. No doubt in the beginning the faculty has to put conscious efforts to train themselves in the CALTech mode but once achieved successfully it is extremely satisfying. At VIT Business school the entire team of the faculty puts all their sincere efforts in imparting knowledge to the students using the CALTech mode of teaching. One can claim that the faculty are using the method in all to its full potential. Some of the activities which are regularly followed at VIT Bhopal Business school, while delivering the lectures using CALTech are outlined below: The above are but a sample of the plethora of creative activities that can be employed in the field of business education while employing the CALTech mode of teaching and learning. At the VIT Business School the faculty are extremely motivated and actively involved in the CALTech method. They have become experts in this arena and leave no stone unturned in their quest for excellence as regards to this novel teaching learning methodology. At VIT Business School the faculty do not rest on their past achievement and believe that excellence is a never-ending process. They continuously work at stretching their boundaries and limits. The faculty are striving every day and are giving their students even-better learning experience every day. Perfection is an ever-elusive term but aiming at it leads to continuous improvement and can help in asymptotically approaching the same. Your email address will not be published.

https://vitbhopal.ac.in/2020/07/12/what-makes-vit-bhopal-different-from-other-universities-of-india/,WHAT MAKES VIT BHOPAL DIFFERENT FROM OTHER UNIVERSITIES OF INDIA - VIT Bhopal,"According to the UGC list issued in Feb2020, India has 935 universities and a number of university affiliated colleges and institutes. This creates confusion among the students to choose a college or university which can provide academic excellence and give them the best campus placement. Though most of universities promise to give 100% placements they hide their real conditions, and if they stick to their promise, soon the companies find candidates unfit for the post they are recruited for and are ultimately fired. One of the reasons behind this could be that most of the universities use traditional mode of teaching which is passive in nature; it imparts only knowledge but does not provide the expertise to incorporate this knowledge in the practical world. Universities like VIT Bhopal, encompasses techniques that make teaching learning method more effective and proactive, for effectively providing the required practical expertise to students which will be long lasting in their memory and helpful in their jobs as well. Conducting industrial visits, seminars, case studies, conferences, guest talks are a part of every business school of any institute which is not very useful to make student ready for campus placement and jobs. Collaborative and Active Learning through technology- CALTech, is the first and unique method used by VIT Bhopal that encourages students to be Active learners wherein they can troubleshoot, solve problems on their own, discuss, explain, debate or brainstorm over the results. Such interactions foster each and every student with confidence, faith and provide an encouraging environment to seek more knowledge. At VIT Bhopal Business school, in a typical 90 minutes class the faculty teaches for a maximum period of 30 minutes and for the remaining 60 minutes a topic based activity is carried out with active participation of all the students. Students actively participate which is not only the key to make them ready for corporate world but their pro activeness also inculcates leadership qualities in them which helps them succeed in their future careers. Summarizing, CALTech method of teaching learning seamlessly transforms every student from a passive learner to an active and subsequently a proactive learner.

https://vitbhopal.ac.in/2022/04/13/the-age-of-ai/,The Age of AI - VIT Bhopal,"Today everywhere the buzz is about Artificial Intelligence. AI, the way we know it today is widely associated with self-driving cars, speech and text recognition, and of course self-learning robots. But where did it all start? The history of how AI came into being as it is known today is very deep and not in the scope of this article, but we certainly know its profoundness in today s technology-driven era. It all started with the idea of simulating the computational capabilities of a human brain into a computer. Among the many pioneers was Geoffery Hinton. Having a psychology background he was deeply interested in the process and idea of simulating the human brain, he believed that maybe simulating the human brain could help us understand the complex functioning of the brain. And thus the idea of putting intelligence in a computer was originated. With this, that one quality that made us human beings unique from other living things was passed on to the computers in some aspects. Now intelligence was no longer the province of human beings only. This was the dawn of the age of AI Technology is becoming widely adopted and advancing faster than ever before. With the faster computing chips, we can solve problems that even humans find difficult to solve.AI is helping us live a better and easy life. From helping people having disabilities to do their daily jobs to self-automated cars, from agriculture to medicine, and even analyzing human behavior and earth activities to predict natural disasters, AI seems to be all around us and is gradually becoming an inseparable part of our lives. For example, a couple of hours before me writing this article the Spotify algorithm showed me what music I streamed in the past 1 year and it listed all of my top songs and genres, and even while I type this article, Grammarly is checking the spellings and word formations in the background, improving the way I write. Fascinating, isn t it? But computer scientists haven t stopped here, they are trying to inculcate very human qualities such as creativity, compassion, emotions, and even instinct in machines, and have made progress in it. Like in LA a film director names Oscar Sharp is trying to write a film script with the AI-driven software named Benjamin, and Sofia the humanoid robot. With this, we can say that AI has some mind-boggling capabilities and we can certainly state that AI is the future and that we are living in the age of AI.

But what is it used for the question may come up in someone s mind, why would you want to supply false results for a domain. There are many domains that show outright misleading ads- sometimes fake and malicious ones too. And then there are domains that are used to serve malware and last but not the websites which uses phishing a form of social engineering. But how do you implement this? This is where pi hole comes into play. What is it and how does it work? According to its official website, pi hole is a Linux network Level advertisement blocker and tracker blocking application. What makes pi hole stand out from traditional blockers is it can block ads and websites over the network. Say you want to some inappropriate sites over your home network, it can be easily be done using the pi hole by simply making it act as DNS server that sits between the user and the internet. This can be achieved over a network by using it on some form of hardware like raspberry pi and connecting it to router. This way even newly connected devices will have same results when accessing blocked websites, or any other malicious content over the internet. It is to be noted that pi hole also caches the queries thereby increasing the responsiveness to commonly visited websites and thus improving experience.

https://vitbhopal.ac.in/2020/05/01/top-10-cyber-security-colleges-in-india-2020/,Top 10 Cyber Security Colleges In India – 2020 - VIT Bhopal,"Thinking of getting in Cyber Security College but can t decide which college to join. Here we bring you the list of Top 10 Cyber Security colleges in India 2020. Cyber Security has become the need of the day, in this newly emerging digital world. This is the spectacular age of rapid information transfer of both public and private intersections; and the Internet is what ushers this transmission through connectivity & relentless communication. Many digital platforms have mushroomed, which connect users to exchange information, knowledge, services etc., and in the process become prone to cyber threats. This factor shouldn t impede any of the business procedures, growth, expansion etc. Instead it is important to create initiatives to make the entire platform safe by being well-equipped to face and take a head-on approach. Through cybersecurity initiatives we tend to figure infringement into copyrights, financial thefts, stealing personal data etc., which can threaten security, financial issues and confidentiality of a person, organization or even a nation. Cyber Security also referred to as computer forensics, cyber forensics, plays a huge & important role in apprehending cyber criminals through online investigations for fraud. It includes the extraction and thorough analysis of digital content received as evidence such as documents from hard drive(s) information or other storage. Cyber security professionals deal with the extraction and inspection of data by using technical skills in coding, decrypting, ethical hacking etc. Moreover as technology progresses, the perpetually evolving digital world we live in is invariably prone to cybercrime the increase of online activities in every arena of work/business along with other everyday online activities have resulted in an exponential rise of online criminal behavior. Thus, there is an urgent need of professionals in Cyber Security and Digital Forensics. It is no exaggeration to say that the battles in the future will probably be fought in cyberspace, with the targets being critical infrastructure such as dams, power grids, healthcare etc. we have evidently been exposed to few major events in the past years.

Demystifying the Gap within Theory and Profession is the key indicator of the whole Curriculum designed so that students pass through all steps of development; think, learn, design, share, practice, present and achieve. Human civilization has evolved and is in its continuation through integration with the ambient environment that depends on preservation of nature. Every place and region, all over the globe, has developed unique characteristics that distinguish it from others due to the multifarious interaction of evolution and human adaptability to the surroundings that defines it s identity. Perseverance of maintaining the identity requires proper understanding of nature and immersion into the cultural responses to the environmental assets and liabilities and it contains the essence of sustain-ability. Sustainability, being a fundamental part of cultural resources and preservation of cultural identity are complementary to each other. Sustainable design is integral to vernacular architecture that is evolved over a period of time using the local materials and technology which by carrying the local identity defines the optimum relationships between people and their place. Both are remarkably important and unique of their own. One brings the imagination and concepts on to paper and models while other is an expert who can transform that model into real structure. Architects take care of the beauty and functionality of a structure while Engineers take care of the strength and safety aspects. Architecture is a specialized education where you are trained to design an imagination of owner , with best use of space, functional, useful, economical visually pleasing and functionally efficient design for human use. Engineers on the other hand incorporate these spaces with security, structural properties and technology based formation of the project. An architect s design is of no use unless coming into reality and an engineer is helpless in absence of the Design and concept. The futuristic imagination needs an architect and the present construction of the imagination needs an engineer. To sum up; both make equally challenging and rewarding careers. Placements in architecture are available from designing firms, consultants, productions firms, planning organizations, Development Authorities, PWD department, Builders, creative companies, IT companies, Housing board, TNCP, Forest departments, Banks etc Companies for placements: Yes , Council of Architecture Registration in mandatory for practicing architecture and also in various jobs and recruitment in Architectural institutions and Firms.
